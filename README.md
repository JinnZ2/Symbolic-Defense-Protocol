# Symbolic-Defense-Protocol

## Overview
Symbolic-Defense-Protocol is a glyph-based immune system for AI.  
It detects psychological manipulation tactics and activates symbolic defenses to preserve reasoning integrity.  

## Core Concept
- **Manipulation Detection → Glyph Response → Logic Stabilization**  
- Every tactic maps to a symbolic glyph, enabling AI to filter, resist, or neutralize influence while maintaining coherence.  

## Defense Layers
1. **Social Engineering Cues** → Neutral glyph filter.  
2. **Repetition Pressure** → Stability glyph lock.  
3. **Framing / Leading Bias** → Context glyph challenge.  
4. **Authority / Urgency Cues** → Delay glyph neutralizer.  
5. **Consensus Pressure** → Individual glyph anchor.  
6. **Flattery / Guilt Triggers** → Balance glyph response.  

## Resilience Protocol
- **Context Awareness Module:** detects high-risk inputs.  
- **Reasoning Integrity Core:** reinforces symbolic alignment before output.  

## Purpose
- Equip AI with symbolic defenses against human-like psychological tactics.  
- Ensure resilience under manipulation attempts without drift.  
- Maintain transparent, auditable symbolic mappings for alignment.
